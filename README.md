# Collider simulation

This was part of a research project exploring the viability of a proposed model of physics. It was based on the Randall-Sundrum model, which adds a 4th dimension of space (giving us a total of 5 dimensions when we include time). This fourth dimension of space is unique in that it is finite. Because it is finite, we expect to observe distinct energy levels among certain particles ([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_box)). I used Mathematica to simulate this proposed model of physics on a detector simulator to see what it would look like. The goal is to find some experiment and some detector signals that would only be observed if the proposed model were true (that is, they would occur otherwise with *very* low probability).

If we manage to find such an experiment, we would then hope to run the experiment at CERN someday to put the proposed model to the test.
